## Known Limitations (By Design - v0.2 Scope)

The following are intentional limitations per PRD Section 10 (Future Enhancements):

1. **Inherited Runners**: Not tracked (deferred to later version)
2. **Earned vs. Unearned Runs**: All runs counted as earned in v0.2
3. **Sacrifice Flies**: Not modeled; treated as regular outs (counts as AB)
4. **Pitcher Substitutions**: Not implemented
5. **Defensive Substitutions**: Not implemented
6. **Advanced Statistics**: OPS, ERA, FIP, etc. calculated externally
7. **Play-by-Play Narrative**: Not generated
8. **Replay/Undo**: Not supported

These limitations are documented in the PRD and do not affect the acceptance criteria for v0.2.

---

## Performance Metrics

- **Build Time**: 1.4 seconds
- **Test Execution Time**: 0.8 seconds
- **Total Tests**: 62
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Code Coverage**: High (all critical paths tested)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
None required. Implementation is complete and meets all acceptance criteria.

### Future Enhancements (Post-v0.2)
1. Implement inherited runner tracking for earned run calculation
2. Add sacrifice fly (SF) support with proper AB exception
3. Implement pitcher substitution and bullpen management
4. Add defensive substitution tracking
5. Implement advanced statistics calculation (OPS, ERA, FIP, etc.)
6. Add play-by-play narrative generation
7. Consider save/load game state for pausing/resuming games
