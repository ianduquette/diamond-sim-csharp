### ‚ùå Critical Gaps

#### 1. Error Counting Formula
**Coverage:** 0%
**Required Test:** Verify `E = count(ROE)` when no explicit fielding errors
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** Low (1 test)

**Recommended Test:**
```csharp
[Test]
public void ErrorCount_EqualsRoeCount_WhenNoExplicitErrors() {
    // Simulate game with known ROE occurrences
    // Verify team E = count of ROE plays
}
```

#### 2. AB Calculation Formula
**Coverage:** 20% (basic sanity only)
**Required Test:** Explicit verification of `AB = PA - BB - HBP - SF`
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** Low (1 test)

**Recommended Test:**
```csharp
[Test]
public void AtBats_EqualsFormula_PaMinusBbHbpSf() {
    // Create scenario with known PA, BB, HBP, SF counts
    // Verify AB = PA - BB - HBP - SF for each batter
}
```

#### 3. IP Thirds Explicit Mapping
**Coverage:** 30% (regex only)
**Required Test:** Verify 0 outs‚Üí.0, 1 out‚Üí.1, 2 outs‚Üí.2
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** Low (1 test)

**Recommended Test:**
```csharp
[Test]
public void InningsPitched_FormatsThirds_Correctly() {
    // Test: 0 outs = X.0, 1 out = X.1, 2 outs = X.2
    // Test: 27 outs = 9.0, 28 outs = 9.1, 29 outs = 9.2
}
```

#### 4. Snapshot Baseline Comparison
**Coverage:** 50% (files stored but not compared)
**Required:** Implement baseline file comparison
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** Medium (modify existing tests)

**Current State:** Tests generate output and validate LogHash but don't compare against stored baselines.

**Recommended Enhancement:**
```csharp
[Test]
public void Snapshot_Seed42_MatchesBaseline() {
    var output = RunGame(42);
    var baseline = File.ReadAllText("__snapshots__/Report_seed_42.txt");
    // Compare excluding timestamp line
    Assert.That(NormalizeOutput(output), Is.EqualTo(NormalizeOutput(baseline)));
}
```

## Bugs Found During Verification (v1.1 Update)

### üêõ Bugs Discovered and Fixed

#### 1. Shortstop Error Bug (FIXED)
**Issue:** All errors were hardcoded to E6 (shortstop)
**Location:** `GameSimulator.cs` line 253
**Impact:** Unrealistic error distribution
**Fix:** Added `GetRandomFieldingPosition()` to distribute errors across positions 1-9
**Test Added:** None (should add error distribution test)

#### 2. Box Score R Column Inconsistency (RESOLVED)
**Issue:** Individual R values didn't match team totals
**Root Cause:** Architectural limitation - no base-to-lineup tracking
**Impact:** Confusing output showing 0 R for batters who scored
**Resolution:** Removed R column from v1 output
**Documentation:** `.docs/box_score_runs_limitation.md`

#### 3. LOB TOTALS Hardcoded to Zero (FIXED)
**Issue:** Box score TOTALS row showed 0 for LOB
**Location:** `GameReportFormatter.cs` lines 197, 224
**Impact:** Incorrect totals display
**Fix:** Changed to use `_scorekeeper.AwayTotalLOB` and `_scorekeeper.HomeTotalLOB`
**Test Added:** None (should add LOB totals reconciliation test)

#### 4. HR Attribution by Position Number (FIXED)
**Issue:** Box score showed players by sequential position (1-9) instead of batting order
**Location:** `GameReportFormatter.cs` display logic
**Impact:** HR stats appeared on wrong players
**Fix:** Display players in actual batting order from lineup
**Test Added:** None (should add lineup order consistency test)

#### 5. OutsAfter Display Bug (FIXED)
**Issue:** Double plays showed "0 outs" instead of cumulative outs
**Location:** `InningScorekeeper.ApplyPlateAppearance()` return value
**Impact:** Confusing play log
**Fix:** Return 3 when half-inning ends, not reset value
**Test Added:** None (should add outs display test)

### üìã Recommended Tests for Bug Prevention

1. **Error Distribution Test** - Verify errors occur across all positions, not just one
2. **LOB Totals Reconciliation** - Verify box score TOTALS LOB matches team totals
3. **Lineup Order Consistency** - Verify box score displays players in batting order
4. **Outs Display Accuracy** - Verify outs phrase uses cumulative outs, not reset value
5. **HR Attribution** - Verify HR stats appear on correct players in batting order

## Test Coverage Metrics

**Current State:**
- Total Tests: 150
- Passing: 150 (100%)
- PRD Requirements Covered: 75%
- Bugs Found: 5 (all fixed)
- Bugs with Tests: 0 (need to add)

**Target State:**
- Total Tests: 165 (add 15)
- PRD Requirements Covered: 95%
- Bugs with Tests: 5 (prevent regression)

---

## Conclusion

The test suite provides strong coverage of core functionality with identified gaps in formula verification and edge cases. The bugs found during verification highlight the need for additional tests to prevent regression. All bugs have been fixed, but tests should be added to ensure they don't reoccur.

**Recommendation:** Implement Phase 1 tests (8 tests) to achieve 95% PRD compliance and prevent regression of fixed bugs.
